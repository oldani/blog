So I don't know where to start. For a long time, I have been tempted to start
blogging about technical stuff, live experience on the community, etc ...

I guess the first time someone encourages me to do so was `Jessica Forde` on
**PyCaribbean 2018**, to tell the world about my history on how I got to the
python world and how it improved my live *(more on that on a later post)*

Moving to the present, some days ago I saw a lightning talk from my friend
[Andrew Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda) at PyCon and I decided it was time
to make this real. The next step was to figure out how was this going to be done.
Do I create a *Django or Flask* site with serverless or a static site generator?

Static sites generator win this time since I just want to write and share my
stories. Ok, so which one do we use a JS one to demonstrate my front end
knowledge or a python one? Well, I have ended up with Hugo (Golang) for simple
and beauty out of the box templates.

This is the start of a large journey that I hope we all enjoy and learn.

See you:)
