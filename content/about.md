### Ordanis Sanchez Suero | Full Stack Web Developer

I'm a passionate developer who loves coding, breaking and solving challenges, who adapts quickly to any environment and love agile development.
 
I consider myself a team player and pythonic person who love clean code, refactoring and improving apps performance.

I'm always looking to learn something new. Like to talk about architecture/design, work with things I haven't touch/work with and talk to people about tech or things they don't know.
