Who am I? Well, I'm a guy who loves coding, because it's fun and makes me think.
Makes me try to solve problems, break down challenges and figure out what's going
wrong.

For what purpose I love coding? Doing people lives easier, helping organizations
improve their products (add new features, make product stable, help support,
reduce cost) and more.

Early at my career, I figure out how grateful is contributing to open source, 
so since them I have been contributing to the Python community by creating new
packages, helping existing ones (fixing bugs, closing issues, reviewing PRs,
adding new features) and also lately sharing my knowledge throw meet-ups and
conferences like PyCaribbean.

I consider myself a team player and pythonic person who love clean code,
refactoring and improving apps performance.

I'm always looking to learn something new. Meet new people and make some friends
around the world. And if you're someone that like tech some way I will try to
inspire you to get in this lovely path.


### My Career

I started as a QA automatization engineer working with `Python & Selenium` for testing
the websites of [Hearst Magnazines](https://www.hearst.com/magazines/hearst-magazines-international), where I got to be lead of the team maintaining and
improving our in-house framework on top of selenium, we also built a solution similar
to [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com) with `Docker, Jenkins & Python`.

After that I have been focused on backend development with `Python & Php` mainly,
working on services which received and processed millions of requests and images per day.
I have even build a custom HTTP Proxy to handle thousands of r/m in pyhon (yeah I know,
why would you built a http proxy and why python), basically we have needs and all 
the team knew python.

Nowadays I work with `Django, GraphQL & Celery`. But I have use many other web
frameworks like `(flask, starlette and even web.py)`. Also I have done some
`Computer Vision` stuff with `Keras & Tensorflow`.

Even though I don't mention `Javascript`, I have get my hands dirty on
that also; I mean who don't?
